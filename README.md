# Directional-Tuning
Analysis of Directional Tuning in Single Unit Activity from the Monkey Motor Cortex

Synopsis 

This course module introduces the student to the analysis of directional tuning in single unit recordings from
the motor cortex of the behaving monkey. Goal of this module is to exercise the analysis of single-unit spike train data,
to rehearse basic concepts of neuronal tuning curves and rate coding.
The students will analyze the directional information present in single unit activity recorded from the monkey
primary motor cortex during the preparation and execution of center-out arm reaching movements.
The first part focuses on computing the classical ('static') directional tuning from the average firing rate
in the actual movement phase.
The second part investigates the dynamics of movement encoding using the time-resolved estimation of tuning measures
during the experimental phase of movement preparation. This teaching module addresses master and graduate students from both,
experimental and theoretical background. The module is designed for one course day including an introductory lecture,
practical course work, and final presentation of results.
The experiment and the data have been described in detail in:
